				<p>This is probably the most common mishap. The remedy is simple--yank! It's most easily done
				with two people. One to restrain the bird and the other to pull the feather. Use pliers, or a
				hemostat. Tweezers won't work on primaries. Make certain that the wing bones are firmly supported
				or you can break the wing. Clamp onto the feather and give a sharp tug in the direction of the
				feather. The feather will come out. Next, apply gentle, direct pressure to the follicle where the
				feather was to stop the bleeding. Dab some styptic powder on it, as it will help stop the bleeding
				as well. Let the bird rest. Ask your vet or breeder to demonstrate exactly how to pull a blood
				feather if you're apprehensive about doing it</p>
